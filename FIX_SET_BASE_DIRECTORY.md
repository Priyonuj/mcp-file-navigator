# Fix for set_base_directory Function

## Issue

The `set_base_directory` function is failing with the error:

```
Error setting base directory: path is not defined
```

## Root Cause

The issue is in the `services/toolService.js` file, which is missing the import statement for the `path` module. The tool service tries to use the `path` object (for example, `path.isAbsolute()`), but since it's not imported, it causes an error.

## Fix

1. Edit the `services/toolService.js` file and add the following import at the top:

```javascript
import path from 'path';
```

2. The import should be placed after the existing import for `zod`:

```javascript
import { z } from 'zod';
import path from 'path'; // Added missing import
```

## Applying the Fix

You can fix this issue in one of two ways:

### Option 1: Manual edit

1. Open the `services/toolService.js` file in a text editor
2. Add the import statement as described above
3. Save the file
4. Restart the MCP server

### Option 2: Using the helper script

1. Run the `set_base_dir_helper.js` script with Node.js:
   ```
   node set_base_dir_helper.js
   ```
2. Restart the MCP server

## Verifying the Fix

After applying the fix and restarting the server, you should be able to use the `set_base_directory` function without errors:

```
set_base_directory D:\My_World\mcp\azureDevops\mcp-server
```

## Additional Information

The server needs to be restarted after making changes to the code for them to take effect. The changes you make to the files will persist, but the running instance of the server won't pick up these changes until it's restarted.
